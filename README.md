# Progression

A music harmonisation tool to assist in composition.

## Tools

### BPM Clicker

A simple BPM Clicker to help you find the tempo for music you are writing. This requires no additional resources from your system. Tap on the button on the screen in the tempo you are trying to find and the App will calculate the BPM based on this. Tap on Reset to go back to 0 BPM.

### Harmonisation Tool

A tool to generate chord progressions. Progression will need access to the internet to enable audio playback. Otherwise, the chord Progressions will generate depending on the 'Starting Chord' selected from the 'Starting Key', which can be chosen from the dropdowns on the screen. The number of chords to be generated can be selected from the Number Picker on the right from 4 to 32 chords.

Once done, press 'Start' to generate the progression. The 'Play' bottom will produce audio playback and the 'Save' button can be used to save progressions that you like. 'View Saves' will show these saved progressions. 'View Chord Charts' will display the charts for the chords in the selected key.

### Tuner

Requires access to your microphone to work. Press 'Start' to begin recording and sound the pitch you want to find. The tuner will listen and display the sound pitch. Press 'Stop' to end the recording.
